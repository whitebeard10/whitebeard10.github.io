                  I led this project in my 5th semester as a part of my Software
                  engineering project component. This project was a unique idea
                  where we intended for farmers and consumers to connect
                  digitally without the involvement of middleman. The project
                  provided valuable experience in project management, web
                  development, and ecommerce.

                <h3>Sign Language Detection</h3>
                <p>Python | AI | ML | CNN</p>
                <p class="decs">
                  In this project, we developed a model using Convolutional
                  Neural Network (CNN) to detect sign language and convert it
                  into English alphabets. We collected a dataset of hand sign
                  images and preprocessed them using OpenCV to apply
                  transformations like black and white conversion, Gaussian
                  blur, and binary inversion. Two different sequential models
                  were created, and the second model included dropout to prevent
                  overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 99.18%. The model was
                  trained using CNN layers and compiled using the Adam optimizer
                  algorithm with categorical cross-entropy as the loss function.
                  We plotted graphs of loss and accuracy versus epochs to check
                  for overfitting. The saved model was then deployed on a web
                  app using Flask, and HTML with bootstrap templates was used
                  for styling the pages. This project aimed to enhance
                  communication for people who don't understand sign language
                  and achieved high accuracy in detecting hand signs.

                <h3>Text-Summarizer-with-WSD</h3>
                <p>Python | AI | NLP | Flask</p>
                <p class="decs">
                  This project is a text summarization system with Word Sense
                  Disambiguation (WSD) implemented using Python and various NLP
                  libraries. The system takes a paragraph of text as input and
                  performs Part-of-Speech tagging and Named Entity Recognition
                  using the spaCy library. It then identifies repeating words
                  with different POS tagging and creates a list of potential
                  target words for WSD. The system generates summaries for each
                  target word using the T5 transformer model from Hugging Face,
                  and compares the results using the Rouge evaluation metric.
                  The system also uses an n-gram model to predict the most
                  appropriate word for each target word, based on the context.
                  The output is the summary with the highest Rouge score. The
                  system is implemented as a Flask web application . The
                  application allows users to input a paragraph of text and get
                  a summary with the best Rouge score. The project includes a
                  detailed README.txt file with instructions on how to run the
                  application, a requirements.txt file with all the
                  dependencies, and a license file. The code is well-documented
                  and follows best practices for Python development.

                <p class="decs">
                  It is an Android application developed using Android Studio. This mobile app serves as a dynamic and convenient platform for hostel students to facilitate the sharing of various items among their peers within the same hostel or dormitory.

At its core, this app allows users to post requests for specific items they need or alternatively, browse and accept requests from fellow students seeking assistance with particular items. This innovative solution fosters a sense of community and resource sharing among hostel residents.

Whether it's borrowing a charger for a few hours, finding a textbook for an upcoming exam, or requesting a kitchen appliance for a one-time use, this app streamlines the process of acquiring these items. Hostel students can easily connect with one another, helping to fulfill immediate needs without the hassle of purchasing or searching for items outside of their immediate network.
